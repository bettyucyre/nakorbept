# How to Get Unbanned on NARAKA Bladepoint (2025 Guide) ⚔️

Getting banned from NARAKA Bladepoint can feel like getting knocked out mid-duel — super frustrating, especially if you think it was an unfair hit. This quick and snappy guide will help you figure out why you got banned and how to send your best appeal to climb back into the fight.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did you get banned immediately after making a fresh account, or does the ban chase you across all your new characters? You might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! This means NARAKA Bladepoint has your PC hardware flagged, so even new accounts get the cold shoulder.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check any emails or in-game messages from the NARAKA Bladepoint team or their publisher to see why you’re banned. Usual suspects include:
- Cheating or using forbidden third-party software  
- Toxicity or harassment in the community  
- Suspicious account activity or sharing accounts  

**Pro tip:** Always peek at the game’s Terms of Service before hammering out that appeal.
